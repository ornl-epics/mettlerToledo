Terminator = "\r\n";
ReplyTimeout = 2000;

LongTimeout = 60000;

# Note on timeouts:
#
# The 2s timeout for general commands seems necessary. I often didn't get a reply 
# within 1s, even though most of the time the response is well below 1s and we can 
# poll weight at 10Hz.
#
# The LongTimeout is for the blocking stable weight, tare and zero commands. If 
# the scaler isn't stable these commands can take a long time to complete, until
# a timeout is reached in the scale (which seems to be about 30s in the one I tested).

# General functions

# Note: for the string commands the device will send 
#       a string back in quotes like "blah" so it's 
#       hard to use %s or %c without getting the quotes.
#       So I found that a character based format converter 
#       works fine, where I read all characters except a quote mark.
